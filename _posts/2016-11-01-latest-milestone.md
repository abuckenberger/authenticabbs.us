I write this with the fullest heart in a time of transition and growth. My college career has surely come to an end and my new journey is well on it's way. 

For the longest time I was afraid of graduating. It was as if I thought I could only obtain knew knowledge and learn while in school. It wasn't until this year that I saw the parallel between Design and Humans. We are always growing, changing, and learning. We are never done. There is no perfect. So there is nothing to be afraid of. In fact, the more often we fail, the closer we are to finding the solution.

I am so grateful for the education I received. From it I have gained a comprehensive and very meta outlook on life. I have zoomed way out, I am constantly seeing the bigger picture. I was pushed, supported, and valued while earning my Degree and for that I am forever grateful.

The best thing I have picked up over the last four years in Design is that it's a People thing. Not a pixel thing.

Happy learning, fellow Grads! May your education never stop.
